# HatchOS
HatchOS is an experimental, [Cosmos](https://www.github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos) based operating system designed for x86_64 computers.

The following resources have been used during development:
* [Cosmos OS development Kit](https://www.github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos)
* [PrismOS](https://github.com/Project-Prism/Prism-OS)

## Features
Here is a list of features that are currently implemented:
* Basic GUI
* Basic serial console
* [WIP] Audio system
* Extremely basic window manager
* Power functionality (Shutdown, Reboot)
* Demo 3D Rasterizer (PrismGraphics)

## Future Plans
I plan to add more functionality to HatchOS. Here is what I want to do:
* Add a file manager
* Add networking
* Add syscalls
* Improve performance and code quality
* Add application support
* Add an API for different system functions
